# Dear professor Vekoslav, 

I refactored the JavaScript codebase to make it more functional, user-friendly, and maintainable by reorganizing logic,
implementing robust input validation, grouping related functions for modularity, and streamlining features like the map functionality
and pollution report form for better usability and performance. Additionally, I added a new section where users can report
pollution in their area, featuring auto-detecting location, attaching photos, selecting pollution type and severity, and providing descriptions.
I also introduced a donation section to support the platform's growth and impact, also i added every european capital town.

Warm regards,
Kristijan Ralevski 5549
